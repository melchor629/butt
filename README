About
-----
butt (broadcast using this tool) is an easy to use, multi OS streaming tool. +
It supports ShoutCast and IceCast and runs on Linux, MacOS and Windows. +
The main purpose of butt is to stream live audio data from your computers Mic or Line input +
to an Shoutcast or Icecast server. Recording is also possible. +
It is NOT intended to be a server by itself or automatically stream a set of audio files. +


Install
-------
.OS X: 
Mount the *butt-<version>.dmg* by double clicking and  +
drop the butt file to the Applications folder. +

.Windows: 
Just run the *butt-<version>-setup.exe* as usual and go through the +
installer pages. +
The default installation path might be unusual, but this way it is possible to install +
butt without administration rights. +

.Ubuntu:
Butt depends on the following packages and their dependencies: +
'portaudio19-dev', 'libvorbis-dev', 'libfltk1.3-dev', 'libmp3lame-dev' +
'libflac-dev', 'libsamplerate-dev', 'libopus-dev' +

Install the .deb package with +
+dpkg --install butt_<version>-0ubuntu1_amd64.deb+ +

.Linux/MinGW:
First of all you need to have the following libraries installed on your system  +
'fltk-1.3', 'portaudio', 'libmp3lame', 'libvorbis', 'libogg', 'libFLAC', 'libopus', 'libsamplerate' +
They are quite common and should be included in every linux distribution +

After installing the above libraries you can install butt from source as usual:

- +tar -xzf butt-<version>.tar.gz+

- +cd butt-<version>+

- +./configure+

- +make+

- +sudo make install+


Quick start
-----------
When you start butt the first time, it will create a default configuration +
file in in your home directory ('~/.buttrc') on Linux and OS X or at +
'C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\buttrc' on Windows. +

In order to connect to a server, you need to add a new server in the config window.  +
Just open the settings window and click on [ADD]. +
Now fill in the input fields with the server data and click on the new [ADD]. +

Adding Stream Infos is not necessary for connecting to a server.


Configuration
-------------
The command line option +-c <path_to_file>+ allows you to define a new standard configuration path.  +
This makes it possible to have multiple instances with different configurations +
running. In case the file does not exists, butt will create a default file. +

[Save]: Saves your current settings to the standard configuration +
file or to the file that was passed to the -c option +
[Export]: Saves your current settings to the given file +
[Import]: Loads the selected file and applies the settings +

CAUTION: If you use the -c command line option and import another configuration file by using the + 
import function, pressing [Save] will overwrite the file that was passed to the -c option.


Main Window
-----------
The dot matrix display shows you the current state of the butt software. +
The states are: idle, streaming, recording. +
When in streaming and/or recording state you can cycle through the information by clicking on the display. +
You can choose between online duration, data sent, recording duration and data recorded +

The [>] symbol shines yellow if butt is connected to a server. +
The [O] symbol shines orange if the +[start rec. when connected]+ checkbox is activated. +
The [O] symbol shines red if butt is currently recording. +

The coloured LED lights (vu-meter) indicate the current input volume.  For best listening experience  +
for you listeners I suggest to have the input volume below or within the orange LEDs.  +
Never let the volume go up to the red LEDs, they indicate saturation. +

Gain slider:
The slider is only visible when the little +[more/less]+ button below  +
the +[settings]+ button was clicked. +
With this slider you can attenuate and amplify the input signal between '-24dB' and  '+24dB', respectively. +
Double clicking the slider resets the gain to '0dB'.  Use this slider only to fine tune your input signal.  +
It does not change the operating systems input volume setting. Instead, the input signal is multiplied +
by the given factor. Thus adding to much gain will also add lots of noise. +


Streaming
---------
To start streaming just klick the play symbol. +
butt will try to connect to the server until you press the stop symbol. +

You can stream with 3 different codecs: mp3, ogg/vorbis and ogg/opus. + 
In case opus is selected the samplerate is always upsampled to 48kHz. +
Upsampling needs lot of CPU power. You can change the upsampling +
algorithm in the +[Advanced]+ settings on the +[Audio]+ tab. Upsampling + 
is deactivated if you select 48kHz as sample rate.


Unfortunately, it is not possible to update Stream Infos while streaming. +
You need to reconnect for updating the Stream Infos. +

However, at least you can update the current song on the fly. +
You only need to type the song into the +Song Name+ input field at the +
+[Stream]+ tab and hit Enter or click +[OK]+. 

butt can also update the song automatically from a text file. +
The first line of the text file must be the name of the song. +
As soon as butt detects that the file has been changed it updates the +
name of the song on the server. +
A plugin for the amarok audio player can be found in the 'player_plugins/' +
directory. +
Don't hesitate to write a plugin for other audio players. +
Just mail them to me and I'll add them to the butt package. +
 
.Stream infos:
In the +[main]+ settings window you can add stream infos. +
This allows you to deliver more details of your stream station. +
For example the genre of your music, description of your station, web address etc. +


Recording
---------
butt is able to record and stream simultaneously in different bit rates. +
For example you can stream with 96kbit and record with 192kbit. +
Recording is possible in mp3, ogg/vorbis, ogg/opus, FLAC or wav. 

In case 'opus' is selected the samplerate is always upsampled to +48kHz+. +
Upsampling needs lots of CPU power. You can change the upsampling +
algorithm in the [Advanced] settings on the [Audio] tab or disable it +
by selecting 48kHz as sample rate. Not all sound interfaces support a +
samplerate of 48kHz, though. +


To record you first need to select the destination folder and specify a file name  +
in the +[Rec]+ tab.  +
butt will replace the variables +%d+, +%m+ and +%y+ with the current day, month and year. +
e.g. +rec_(%m_%d_%y).mp3+ -> +rec_(03_28_2008).mp3+. +
Other possible time variables are +%H+ (hours) +%M+ (minutes) +%S+ (seconds).

 
With the +%i+ variable you can add an index number to your file name. +
This means with +rec_%i.mp3+ butt first tries to open +rec_0.mp3+. If that +
file already exists, butt tries +rec_1.mp3+ and so on... +
 
If the 'start recording when connected' checkbox is activated butt starts the +
recording immediately after being connected to a server. +
 
To manually start the recording press the record symbol. +
To stop recording simply click on the record symbol again. +
 
You can also tell butt to split your recording into
separat files every *n* minutes. Just enter a number higher than 0 +
into the 'Split file every [..] minutes' field. +
Let's assume your file name is +rec_(%m_%d_%y)\_%i.mp3+ Then the first file is +
expanded to +rec\_(03_28_2008)\_0-1.mp3+, the second after *n* minutes to +
+rec_(03_28_2008)\_0-2.mp3+, the third to +rec_(03_28_2008)_0-3.mp3+, you got it. +
If the 'sync to full hour' checkbox is activated the automatic file splitting +
is synchronized to the full hour. That means if the time is '8:55' and file +
splitting is set to '15 minutes', the second file starts at '9:00' and the third +
at '9:15'.


Uninstall
---------
.OS X: 
Delete the *butt.app* from your 'Application' folder and +
remove the configuration file from '/Users/<username>/.buttrc' +

.Windows: 
Run the Uninstaller from the butt folder in your windows start menu. +

.Ubuntu:
Run +sudo apt-get uninstall butt+ and +
remove the configuration file from '/home/<username>/.buttrc' +

.Linux/MinGW: 
Run +sudo make uninstall+ from the source tree. and +
remove the configuration file from '/home/<username>/.buttrc' +
